# Chatbot using Python and NLTK

Welcome to the Chatbot project! This conversational agent is built using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The chatbot responds to greetings, provides information about data science, and handles unknown inputs.

## Introduction

This project implements a simple chatbot using Python and NLTK. The chatbot understands greetings, responds with information on various topics, and gracefully handles unknown inputs.

## Features

- **Greeting Responses:** Engage with the chatbot through various greetings.
- **Topic Information:** Obtain information on a wide range of topics, not limited to data science.
- **Handling Unknown Inputs:** Receive responses when the chatbot encounters unfamiliar queries.
- **Conversational Flow:** Experience multi-turn conversations with the chatbot.

## How it Works

The chatbot follows a basic conversational flow:

1. **Greeting:** It starts with a friendly greeting if the user initiates the conversation with common greetings.

2. **Topic Information:** The chatbot provides information on various topics based on predefined patterns and responses.

3. **Handling Unknown Inputs:** If the chatbot encounters an input it doesn't understand, it gracefully handles it using predefined responses.

4. **Response Generation:** The chatbot uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to generate responses based on the user's input.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language for building the chatbot.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** Utilized for natural language processing, including tokenization and lemmatization.
- **scikit-learn:** Used for TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity calculations.
- **numpy:** Employed for numerical operations.
- **string:** Standard library for string operations.
- **random:** Standard library for generating random responses.
